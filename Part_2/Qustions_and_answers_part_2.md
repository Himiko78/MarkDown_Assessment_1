	1. Answer: The Main Advantages of using GitHub are collaboration, versioning, branching and the community around it.
	

3.	Define the following terms in relation to Git. Branch, Pull, Push, repository, working copy, merge

5.	Merge conflicts can occur while using git. List merge tools or diff tools you can use to help you merge and deal with conflicts.
	1. Answer:Tools and diff tools that can be used to help deal with merge conflicts are KDiff3 which is an open source diff tool that can compare and merge files
	as well as P4Merge which is another open-source merge tool that again can be used to merge and compare files. Both tools listed have graphical user interfaces as well to help solve the conflicts.
	

6.	In a merged source code file, how does Git let you know there is a conflict?
	1. Answer: Git lets the user know by marking the conflict section with speacial markers. These markers are show where the conflict starts and ends  as well as the original code the modified version of the code.

	1. Answer: True


13.	Describe what is DevOps, how is it useful for game developers?
	1. Answer: Devops helps to streamline game development by automating the build and testing it as well as deloy game assets within the game.
	

14.	List what tools can be used with DevOps. Give a brief description of each one. (at least 3)
	1. Answer: Tools that can be used with devops are:
	
	Docker which is a containerization platform that allows developers to pacakge their apps into containers.
	Git which is a version control system which allows devs to track changes to their code over time.
	Puppet is a open source configuration manager tool that can automate various parts of software dev processes.
	

15.	What is CI/CD and how can it be used to automate the game development process?
	1. Answer:CI/CD stands for Continuous intergration and continuous deployment.
	
	It can be used to automate the game dev process through automated builds and automated testingss as well through version control.
	It can be used to automate the game dev process through automated builds and automated testingss as well through version control.
